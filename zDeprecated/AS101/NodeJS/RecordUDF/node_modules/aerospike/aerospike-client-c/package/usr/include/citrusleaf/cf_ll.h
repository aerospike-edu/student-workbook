/*
 * SYNOPSIS
 * LinkedList
 * Sometimes the answer is a doubly linked list. It's not that frequent, but
 * all the corner cases in a double linked list can be annoying.
 *
 * the current use pattern is the caller creates a structure that starts with a 'cf_ll_element',
 * ie, can be cast to a cf_ll_element. The caller allocates and frees the memory.
 * (There are far cooler ways to do this, so if you want to improve this, go ahead!
